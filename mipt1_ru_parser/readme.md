This program can be used to identify physics problems from Ovchinkin's books for which there is a solution given in Koryavov's books.

<H4>HOW TO USE</H4>
You need to prepare a file with problems beforehand and paste a path to it when asked by the program.<br />
(You can refer to example_file.txt to understand the expected format).<br />
Next you need to select which Ovchinkin's book those tasks originate from and wait for the program to finish.<br />
(Please note that if mipt1.ru tries to resist being scrapped via spamming requests, this code will stop working, so please understand and accept the AS-IS nature of this project)
